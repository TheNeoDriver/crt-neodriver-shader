-- CRT Neodriver Reshade --

1. Install Reshade in your game.

2. Copy the content of this folder ("crt-neodriver.fx"
file and "shaders" folder) into new folder in your
"/reshade-shaders/shaders/..." path.

3. Activate crt-neodriver and configurate the resolution
for the game (first parameter). This is the key to change
the visuals.

4. Enjoy.
