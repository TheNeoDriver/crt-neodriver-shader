-- CRT Neodriver Reshade --

1. Install Reshade in your game.

2. Copy the content of this folder ("crt-neodriver.fx"
file and "shaders" folder) into new folder in your
"/reshade-shaders/shaders/..." path.

3. Activate crt-neodriver and configurate the resolution
for the game (first parameter). This is the key to change
the visuals. (Tested on 768p and 1080p: for 768p best results
use 480 as the game resolution value, and for 1080p
use 540.)

4. Enjoy.
